# Pensano Developers  
Pensano is Italian for they think; and the developers at Pensano Developers do just that: they are problem solvers, they think outside the box, and they are deliberate.

As a team of four graduates from Makers Academy, each is skilled at working in agile environments, test-driven development, object-oriented programming, and at quickly adapting to new tech stacks. We believe that technology has the power to change lives and make a difference, therefore, we actively seek out opportunities to collaborate with organizations that align with our values and share our vision for creating a better world. 

This site was designed to showcase our work both collectively, as Pensano Devs, and our individual projects.

# Ideation and Planning
Aiming for a mobile-responsive website, we used Excalidraw, Canva and Trello for diagramming, prototyping and tracking our progress.
