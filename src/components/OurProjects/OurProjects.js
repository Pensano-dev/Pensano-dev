              The idea was intially formed at the Athena Hackathon 2023 by Elsa,
              Ju, Natasha, Sidra and Tian, which was awarded both the Cisco
              prize: "Empowering Accessibility & Inclusion Through Innovation‚Äù
              and the Nationwide prize: ‚ÄúHighest Potential Impact‚Äù. This mobile
              app hopes to support social inclusion by helping users find venues
              catered to their specific needs, whether related to physical
              accessibility, neurological considerations, or creating the right
              ambience.

            <p>
              Our very first project working as Pensano Devs was to developed
              this website to showcase our work. It focuses on mobile
              responsiveness and has a consistent colour scheme and typography
              throughout. Thanks to the use of Excalidraw and Canva, we were
              able to create detailed diagrams and prototypes that helped guide
              the site's design and layout. We also used Trello and Slack to
              track progress and communicate with one another. This is a
              front-end project, built with React and CSS.
